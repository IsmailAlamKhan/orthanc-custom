# This is a version-script for the main Orthanc binary, that hides all
# the global functions of the executable so that a Linux Standard Base
# (LSB) build of Orthanc can load plugins that are not built using
# LSB. Otherwise, the dynamic loader of the plugins will try to use
# the global functions published by the Orthanc server, which results
# in a segmentation fault if the data structures don't have the same
# memory layout (e.g. debug vs. release, or another version of some
# C/C++ library used both by Orthanc, typically jsoncpp).
